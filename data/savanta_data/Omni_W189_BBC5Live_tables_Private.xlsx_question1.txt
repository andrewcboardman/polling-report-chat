Question Number: 2
Question Text: Q2. You mentioned that you have experienced or witnessed anti-social behaviour in your local area. Has this behaviour ever made you feel any of the following?

The purpose of this question is to understand the emotional impact of witnessing or experiencing anti-social behavior in one's local area. The key findings indicate that a significant proportion of respondents felt angry/annoyed (45%), unsafe walking alone (30%), frightened (18%), and unsafe in their homes (12%) due to anti-social behavior. The data also reveals variations in responses based on demographics such as gender, age, region, and social grade, providing insights into the differing experiences and perceptions of anti-social behavior across different segments of the population.
