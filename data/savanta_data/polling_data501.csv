,"Q3_W3. Thinking of next year (2024) do you intend to take part in any volunteering activities (formal or informal) in your local community?By 'local community' we mean the local area where you live. By 'formal volunteering' we mean providing unpaid help through an organised group, club, or organisation. By 'informal volunteering' we mean providing any unpaid help that you as an individual have given to other people, but not through a group, club, or organisation. This could be help for a friend, neighbour, or someone else, but not a relative",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
