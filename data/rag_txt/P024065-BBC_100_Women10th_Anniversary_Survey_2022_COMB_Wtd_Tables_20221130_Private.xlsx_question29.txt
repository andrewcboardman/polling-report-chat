Question text: "Q11. If you were the victim of a gender-based crime (e.g. domestic abuse, rape, forced marriage, female genital mutilation), how likely or unlikely would you be to report the crime to the police in your country?"

Purpose: This question aims to gauge the willingness of women across different countries to report gender-based crimes to the police authorities.

Key findings: The data reveals that overall, a majority (50.3%) of respondents said they were "very likely" to report a gender-based crime to the police, while 29.8% said they were "quite likely" to do so. However, there were significant variations across countries, with respondents from Pakistan (17%), Saudi Arabia (52%), and Nigeria (49%) being the least likely to report such crimes. In contrast, respondents from Brazil (78%), China (46%), and Turkey (49%) were among the most likely to report gender-based crimes to the police.
