Question text: "Q9a. For each of the following types of debt, please tell us whether it was a new debt for your household in the last six months (since November 2022) or if you already had it before November 2022, and if it has changed in size?"

Purpose: This question aims to understand the debt situation of low-income households, specifically whether they have acquired new debts or if their existing debts have increased or remained the same in the last six months.

Key findings: The data shows the proportion of respondents who reported having various types of debts as new debts, existing debts with increased size, or existing debts with no increase. Some notable findings include:

- Around 11% of respondents reported having a new "buy now pay later/hire purchase" debt and 9% reported a new credit card debt in the last six months.
- Borrowing from family or friends was the most common new debt, with 11% of respondents reporting it as a new debt.
- For existing debts, credit card debt (12%) and overdraft debt (8%) were the most common types where the size had increased since November 2022.
- A significant proportion of respondents (ranging from 58% to 84%) did not hold certain types of debts, such as loans from unlicensed lenders, Universal Credit advance payments, or loans from credit unions.
