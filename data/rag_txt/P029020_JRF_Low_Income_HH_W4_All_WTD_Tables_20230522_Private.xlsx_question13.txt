Question number: 24b.3

Question text: You mentioned that there are other adults in your household. Which of the following best describes the third other adult's current working status?

Purpose: This question aims to understand the employment status of the third additional adult member in households with more than one adult.

Key findings:
- 10% of households with more than one adult reported that the third additional adult was working for an employer full-time (30 hours or more per week).
- 9% reported the third adult was working for an employer part-time (up to 29 hours per week).
- 3% reported the third adult was self-employed full-time, and another 3% self-employed part-time.
- 10% indicated the third adult was not working but seeking work or temporarily unemployed/sick.
- 3% said the third adult was a student.
- Lower proportions were reported for other working statuses like retired (5%), permanently sick/disabled (6%), house-wife/house-husband (2%), full-time carer (2%), and other categories.

The data provides insights into the diversity of employment situations among additional adult members within low-income households, highlighting the prevalence of part-time and self-employment arrangements alongside unemployment and economic inactivity.
