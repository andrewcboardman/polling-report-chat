Question 27

Purpose: This question aims to assess whether women in different countries feel more or less comfortable discussing gender-based crimes (e.g., domestic abuse, forced marriage, female genital mutilation) with various individuals or entities compared to 10 years ago.

Key Findings: The data reveals that a significant proportion of women feel more comfortable discussing gender-based crimes with friends (68%), partners (65%), and anonymously on social media (64%) compared to 10 years ago. However, fewer women feel more comfortable discussing such crimes with family members (63%) and the police (51%). The level of comfort varies across countries, age groups, employment status, and relationship status.
