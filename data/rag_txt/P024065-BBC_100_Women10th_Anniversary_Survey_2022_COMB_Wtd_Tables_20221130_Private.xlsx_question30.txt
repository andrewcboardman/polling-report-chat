Purpose of the question: The purpose of this question is to gauge how confident women would be that action would be taken against the offender if they were to report a gender-based crime (e.g., domestic abuse, rape, forced marriage, female genital mutilation) to the police in their country.

Key findings:
- Overall, 31% of respondents said they would be very confident, and 34% said they would be somewhat confident that action would be taken against the offender if they reported a gender-based crime.
- There were significant variations across countries, with respondents from China (93%), Saudi Arabia (84%), and Turkey (66%) being the most confident, while those from Mexico (35%), Nigeria (64%), and Pakistan (46%) were the least confident.
- Confidence levels also varied by age, employment status, and relationship status, with younger, working, and single women generally being less confident than older, retired, and married/cohabiting women.
