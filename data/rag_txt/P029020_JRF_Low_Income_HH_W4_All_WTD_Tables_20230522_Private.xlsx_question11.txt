Question number: 24b.1
Question text: You mentioned that there are other adults in your household. Which of the following best describes the first other adult's current working status?

Purpose: This question aims to gather information about the working status of the first additional adult in households with multiple adults.

Key findings:
- The most common working status for the first additional adult was working for an employer full-time (38% of respondents).
- A significant proportion were retired (25%), followed by not working and not seeking work (5%), house-wife/house-husband (5%), and permanently sick/disabled (4%).
- Other working statuses like self-employed (full-time and part-time), part-time employment, student, and temporarily sick accounted for smaller percentages.

The data provides insights into the employment situation of additional adults in low-income households, which can be useful for understanding their economic circumstances and potential financial challenges.
