Q8. NET: What is your total monthly household income from all these sources (including types of income/earnings and benefits), after tax and deductions?

Purpose: This question aims to determine the total monthly household income of the respondents, including all sources of income and earnings, as well as benefits received, after taxes and deductions.

Key findings:
- The mean total monthly household income across all respondents is £1,625.67.
- The income distribution shows a significant portion (around 20%) of households earning between £1,000 and £1,249 per month, followed by those earning between £2,000 and £2,249 (around 21%).
- Households with higher income levels tend to have more adults, be mortgage holders, and reside in certain regions like the South East and London.
- Lower income households are more likely to receive benefits, be renters, and have fewer adults or more children in the household.

The key findings provide insights into the income distribution and characteristics of low-income households, which can inform policies and programs aimed at addressing financial challenges faced by these households.
