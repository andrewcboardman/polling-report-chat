Question text: Q5_4. Anti-lockdown protests : To what extent do you think that the police handle each of the following types protests / demonstrations well or badly?

The purpose of this question is to gauge public perception of how well or poorly the police handle anti-lockdown protests and demonstrations in the UK. The key findings from the data are:

- 45% of respondents believe the police handle anti-lockdown protests well (10% very well, 35% fairly well).
- 38% believe the police handle such protests badly (24% fairly badly, 14% very badly).
- There are notable differences across age groups, with younger respondents (aged 18-34) more likely to perceive the police as handling anti-lockdown protests badly compared to older age groups.
- Political affiliation also plays a role, with Labour and Green Party supporters more critical of the police's handling of these protests than Conservative supporters.
