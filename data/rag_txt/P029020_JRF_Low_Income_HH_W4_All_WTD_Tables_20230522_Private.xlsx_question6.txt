Question 5

Purpose: This question aims to gather information about the composition of the household, including the total number of members, the number of adults (aged 18+), and the number of children in different age groups (0-13 and 14-17).

Key Findings:
- The majority of households (51%) consisted of 2 adults only with no children.
- Around 34% of households had no children.
- Households with 1 child accounted for 11% of the sample, while those with 2 children and 3 or more children made up 23% and 19% respectively.
- Single adult households with at least 1 child comprised 8% of the sample.
- Households with 3 or more adults and no children represented 9% of the respondents.

The data provides insights into the household structures and the presence of children in low-income households, which can be useful for understanding their specific needs and circumstances.
