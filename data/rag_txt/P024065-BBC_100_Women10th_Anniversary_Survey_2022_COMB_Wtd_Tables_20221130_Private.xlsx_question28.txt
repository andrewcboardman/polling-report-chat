Purpose: This question aims to assess whether women across different countries feel less comfortable discussing gender-based crimes with various individuals or entities compared to 10 years ago.

Key Findings: The data reveals that a significant proportion of women feel less comfortable discussing gender-based crimes with the police (20%), anonymously on social media (14%), with family members (12%), with partners (10%), and with friends (9%). The level of discomfort varies across countries, age groups, employment status, and relationship status, indicating the complex nature of this issue and the need for continued efforts to create a supportive environment for addressing gender-based violence.
