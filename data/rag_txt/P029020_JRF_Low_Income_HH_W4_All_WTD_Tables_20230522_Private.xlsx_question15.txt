Question number: 24b.5

Question text: You mentioned that there are other adults in your household. Which of the following best describes the fifth other adult's current working status?

Purpose: This question aims to understand the employment status of the fifth additional adult in households with more than one adult.

Key findings: 
- The majority (65%) of fifth additional adults in low-income households were students.
- 19% were temporarily sick with no job to return to.
- 17% were not working but seeking work or temporarily unemployed.
- Only a small proportion (0%) were working full-time, part-time, self-employed, or retired.

In summary, the data suggests that in low-income households with multiple adults, the fifth additional adult was most likely to be a student or temporarily out of work due to sickness or unemployment.
