Question number: 4
Question text: Q4. To what extent, if at all, are you confident in the ability of the police to tackle anti-social behaviour in your local area?

The purpose of this question is to gauge the public's level of confidence in the police's ability to address anti-social behaviour in their local areas. The key findings from the data are:

- 40% of respondents expressed some level of confidence (9% very confident, 31% fairly confident) in the police's ability to tackle anti-social behaviour.
- 52% expressed a lack of confidence (31% not very confident, 21% not at all confident) in the police's ability to address this issue.
- Confidence levels varied across different demographic groups, with younger age groups (18-34) and those in London and the South-East regions expressing higher levels of confidence compared to older age groups and other regions.
