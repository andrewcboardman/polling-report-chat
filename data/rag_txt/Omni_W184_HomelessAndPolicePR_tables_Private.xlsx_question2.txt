Question Text: "Q1. Summary Not a problem: To what extent would you say that homelessness is, or is not, a problem in each of the following areas?"

Purpose: This question aims to gauge public perception of the extent to which homelessness is not considered a problem in various areas, including neighborhoods, big cities, and the UK in general.

Key Findings:
- 56% of respondents indicated that homelessness is not a problem in their neighborhood.
- Only 12% of respondents felt that homelessness is not a problem in the UK generally.
- 11% of respondents perceived homelessness as not being a problem in the UK's big cities.
The data suggests that while a significant portion of respondents do not view homelessness as a major issue in their immediate surroundings, the majority acknowledge it as a problem at the broader national and urban levels.
