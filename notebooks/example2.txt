Here is another synthetic summary of polling data in the UK:

The latest opinion polling shows the Conservative Party, led by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, holding a slender lead over the opposition Labour Party. According to an average compiled by Britain Elects, the Tories are at 34% among decided voters, with Labour trailing just behind at 32%.

However, there is significant variation between individual pollsters. A recent Redfield & Wilton survey put the Conservatives up 6 points, while a Survation poll had Labour narrowly ahead by 2%. The leftwing party appears to be benefiting from a squeeze on support for the Liberal Democrats, who are down to around 10%.

On the key issue of the economy, voters give the Conservatives only a slight edge in being trusted to handle it best. But Labour has opened up clear leads on priorities like the NHS, education, and the cost-of-living crisis according to many surveys.

Looking at leader favorability ratings, both Sunak and Labour's Keir Starmer remain unpopular overall, with roughly 60% viewing each unfavorably. However, Starmer scores better on attributes like competence and vision for the country.

If an election were held imminently, the polls suggest a hung parliament is one of the likelier outcomes, with no single party holding a majority. The Conservatives may hold a slight advantage in being able to form a governing coalition with smaller unionist parties.

Of course, these are just a snapshot in time and much could change in voting intentions over the remaining years before the next scheduled election in late 2024. The state of the economy will likely be the critical factor driving voters' choices.
