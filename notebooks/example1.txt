Here is a synthetic summary of polling data in the UK:

Recent opinion polls in the United Kingdom have shown a tight race between the governing Conservative Party and the opposition Labour Party. The latest survey from YouGov has Labour holding a narrow 2-point lead over the Tories among decided voters, with 36% supporting Labour and 34% backing the Conservatives. However, other pollsters like Savanta ComRes have found the two parties running neck-and-neck at 33% each.

The smaller Liberal Democrat party is polling in the 12-15% range, while the Green Party and Reform UK are each capturing around 5-7% of the vote in most surveys. There are regional variations, with Labour performing more strongly in urban areas like London, while the Conservatives maintain advantages in many rural constituencies. 

On key issues, the public appears closely divided on the economy, with pluralities trusting Labour slightly more on cost of living but the Tories ahead on economic management. The Conservatives hold leads on immigration and crime, while Labour is seen as stronger on the NHS and education.

Looking ahead to the next general election, expected in 2024 or early 2025, polling averages currently put Labour and the Conservatives in a statistical tie nationally. However, due to the distribution of support, models suggest Labour may have a slight edge in being able to secure a governing majority. Of course, much could still change over the remaining years of this parliament.
